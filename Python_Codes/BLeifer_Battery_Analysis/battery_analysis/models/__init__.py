"""Model definitions for the battery_analysis package.

This module attempts to import the real MongoEngine based models. If
MongoEngine is not installed (for example when running the lightweight unit
tests in this repository), simple dataclass based stand-ins are provided so
that the rest of the package can be imported without requiring MongoDB or
MongoEngine.

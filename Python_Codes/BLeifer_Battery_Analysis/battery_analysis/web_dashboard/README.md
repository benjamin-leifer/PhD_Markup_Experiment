# Web Dashboard

This directory contains a small Dash application that mirrors the planned React-style dashboard layout. The components use placeholder data for now but demonstrate how the UI is structured.

To launch the dashboard locally:

```bash
pip install dash dash-bootstrap-components
python -m battery_analysis.web_dashboard.app
```

The layout roughly follows the high-level design discussed in the project notes.
